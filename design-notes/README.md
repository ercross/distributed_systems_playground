# Design Notes

This directory documents the evolution of the system across versions.

Each file corresponds to a tagged version and explains:
- the constraint introduced
- the failure mode it addresses
- how to reproduce the behavior
- the distributed systems lesson it teaches

These are not changelogs.
They are records of how reliability is earned.
